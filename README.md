# ZuttoZuttoZutto
Welcome to ZuttoZuttoZutto, a completely free virtual pet game framework for you to build upon.

Zutto is a successor to Kitto, written for the modern era. It is written for PHP 7 with the Lumen framework (a stripped-down version of Laravel), takes advantages of modern PHP tools like Composer, and has a first-class mobile experience thanks to Bootstrap.
